SMTP.TestClient
===============

Simple SMTP TestClient from WrapsToGo. This client is a simple winform program, that can send a email based on a few settings. The program is meant to test our WrapsToGo SMTP C# class library.


<h3>How the program works? </h3>
Run the solution file and run the program in debug or build to release, and find the .exe fil in your bin-folder. 

In "File" -> "Settings" you can provide your credentials. 

Write in to, subject and message and click on "Save". 

If the program fails to send and exeception will be thrown as a dialogbox. 

Go luck.
